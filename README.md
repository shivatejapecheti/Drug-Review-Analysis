# Drug-Review-Analysis

Hereâ€™s how each task in our project was achieved:

## Sentiment Analysis:

Objective: Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of drug reviews using NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer.

Implementation:
+ Imported necessary libraries including nltk and nltk.sentiment.vader.
+ Initialized SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() from nltk.sentiment.vader.
+ Iterated through each review in the training dataset (train.review), calculated the compound sentiment score using sid.polarity_scores(i).get('compound'), and stored these scores in an array (sentiments).
+ Converted the list of sentiment scores (sentiments) into a numpy array (np.asarray(sentiments)).

## Rating Prediction:

Objective: Predict the rating of drugs based on textual reviews using machine learning models.

Implementation:
+ Loaded and prepared the dataset (drugsComTrain_raw.csv and drugsComTest_raw.csv) using Pandas (pd.read_csv()).
+ Explored and cleaned the data to handle missing values and basic text cleaning.
+ Utilized TF-IDF vectorization (TfidfVectorizer()) from sklearn.feature_extraction.text to convert text data into numerical features (X_train, X_test).
+ Implemented several classifiers (MultinomialNB, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier) from sklearn to train models on the TF-IDF vectorized data.
+ Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics (accuracy_score), confusion matrices (confusion_matrix), and other metrics (precision_score, recall_score, f1_score).

## Insight Generation:

Objective: Gain insights into the relationships between drug ratings, conditions treated, and sentiment expressed in reviews.

Implementation:
+ Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib (plt) and Seaborn (sns) to visualize distributions of ratings, conditions, and drug names.
+ Generated insights into popular conditions, common drugs, and relationships between ratings, useful counts, and sentiment using descriptive statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps).

## Model Comparison:

Objective: Compare the performance of traditional machine learning models with a deep learning approach using Keras.

Implementation:

+ Designed a deep learning model using Keras Sequential API (Sequential(), Dense()) with multiple layers for classification of drug ratings.
+ Prepared text data for deep learning using one-hot encoding (CountVectorizer() or TfidfVectorizer()).
+ Trained the deep learning model (model.fit()) on the one-hot encoded text data and evaluated its performance using categorical cross-entropy loss (loss='categorical_crossentropy') and accuracy metrics (metrics=['accuracy']).
+ Monitored and visualized training progress over epochs using Matplotlib (plt.plot()).

## Visualization:

Objective: Create visualizations to better understand data distributions and model predictions.

Implementation:
+ Used Matplotlib (plt) and Seaborn (sns) to create various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
+ Visualized distributions of ratings, conditions, and drug names.
+ Plotted relationships between sentiment scores, ratings, and usefulness counts (plt.scatter()).
+ Displayed performance metrics such as confusion matrices (sns.heatmap()) to visualize model evaluation results.

Each task was achieved through systematic data handling, application of appropriate libraries and techniques, and thorough analysis to meet the project objectives effectively.

## Definitions

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
Definition: NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner):
Definition: VADER is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for analyzing sentiments expressed in social media. It quantifies the sentiment of text into positive, negative, or neutral scores, as well as a compound score that combines all three.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):
Definition: TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document within a collection or corpus. It computes a weight for each word in a document based on its frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF), emphasizing words that are more frequent in a particular document but not across the entire corpus.

Machine Learning Models:
Definition: Machine learning models are algorithms that learn patterns and make decisions from data. 
+ Multinomial Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, often used for document classification tasks.
+ Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification that estimates probabilities using the logistic function.
+ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric method used for classification and regression, where the output is based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors.
+ Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes as the prediction.

Deep Learning:
Definition: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain's structure and function, learn from large amounts of data. In your project, deep learning was implemented using Keras, a high-level neural networks API.

One-Hot Encoding:
Definition: One-hot encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into a form that can be provided to machine learning algorithms to improve predictions. Each category is represented as a binary vector where all elements are zero except for the index corresponding to the category, which is set to one.

Confusion Matrix:
Definition: A confusion matrix is a table that visualizes the performance of a classification model, summarizing the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model compared to actual outcomes. It shows counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
